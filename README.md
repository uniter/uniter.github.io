# Uniter

Uniter is...

- A PHP runtime for your browser, or NodeJS.
- A way to run your favorite PHP code in NodeJS - natively! (well, almost.)
- A way to code in your favorite language, whilst not losing anything from the Node side.

Uniter is in active development, and currently, on one ride of it's livetime.
